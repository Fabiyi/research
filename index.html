                    <h1>HISTORY OF WEB</h1>
                    <p>It was an idea introduced by Paul Baran and Donald Davies independently developed concepts for <br>
                        packet-switched networks, which would later be essential to the internet. ARPANET funded by the <br>
                        U.S. Department of Defense, because then first operational packet-switching network in 1969.
                    In 1974,The Internet was introduced by Vint Cert and Bob Kahn who developed the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) <br>
                    and Internet Protocol(IP), which are the fundamental protocols of the internet.  
                    It is also  called world wide web, is a fascinating journey that revolutionized communication, information sharing, <br>
                     and global connectivity.
                     It was invented by Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist in 1989.
                     He proposed the idea of a "hypertext" system that would link document together. He developed key components of the web.

                <li> URL (Uniform Resource Locator):</span> It is the address system used to locate web page.</li>
            </ol>
        
                <p>The first website went live on August 6, 1991 which explain the concept of the World Wide Web.
                The release of web browsers such as Mosaic web browser, Netscape Navigation, Internet Explorer, JavaScript, Google,
                 Social Web such as wikis Facebook, YouTube, X(twitter),Mobile & Cloud era 
                 such as Amazon , Google Cloud ,HTML,CSS3 & JavaScript frameworks,Web3.0 such as AI , machine learning and block chain . 
                 It brought about growth of commercialization with the modern web era.

            <h2>VERSION CONTROL</h2>
            <p>It is a system or practice that manages changes to documents, computer programs, large websites, or other collections of information. <br>
                It keeps track of every modification made to the content, allowing you to revert to previous version, compare changes over time, <br>
                and collaborate with others without conflicting updates. <br>

            A database that stores files and their revision history in a local(on the computer) or remote(on a server)is called <span>REPOSITORY.</span> <br>
            A record of changes made to files in the repository is called COMMIT. <br>
            A separate line of development that diverges from the main project is called <span>BRANCH. </span> <br>
            A situation where different changes have been made to the same part of a file in different branches is called <span> CONFLICT. </span> <br>
            </p>
                <h2>TYPES OF VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM</h2>
            <h3> Central Version Control System (CVCS) </h3>
            <p>It stores all files and their revision history in a central server. The users check out files and work on them, then commit <br>
                changes back on the server.
            Pros: Easier to understand, single source of truth. E.g. Subversion (SVN).
            Cons: If the server goes down, no one can collaborate, and you need a network connection to commit or update. </p>
            <h3> Distributed/Decentralized Version Control System (DVCS) </h3>
            <p> It enable the user make changes locally and later push them to a remote server. <br>
                Every user has a full copy of the repository
            <p> Pros: Allow offline work, supports multiple workflows (like feature branches), and is more resilient to server. <br>
            <p>Cons: Slightly more complex to learn and manage due to distributed nature. </p>
            </h3>
            <h3>USES</h3>
            <p> It is used for software development. </p> <br>
            <p> It is used for document management. </p> <br>
            <p> It is used for website management. </p> <br>
